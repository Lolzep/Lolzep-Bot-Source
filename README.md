# lolzep-bot
Lolzep bot is a hobby project made for a small server focused on rhythm games. It has many basic bot features, but also more unique ones (basic statistics of message channels, volforce calculations for SDVX, moderation tools, message replies to phrases, etc.). It is my first project and is coded poorly. It is mainly here as an archive for reference the collaboration bot between a friend that is known as Kanade Bot https://github.com/LEOIIDX/kanadeBot
